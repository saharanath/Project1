          Altius institute has world class TALEN and TALE-TF production capabilities. TALENs are transcription activator
          like effector nucleases, which are restriction enzymes that are designed to cut DNA with very high specificity. 
          TALEs are delivered into cells through electroporation, electric shock that momentarily blows holes in cells, so
          the TALE mRNA can enter or through the use of retroviral vectors. Electroporation is harsh on the cells leading to 
          lower cell viability and some changes in cellular physiology. Retroviral vectors can be limited in their efficacy as 
          there are carrying capacity constriants and synthesis of these viruses can be difficult.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Altius is working toward the development of reagents that will allow for the delivery of TALEs through the employment
          of supercharge principles. Supercharging is a technique developed by <a href="https://liugroup.us/">the Liu Lab</a> at
          Harvard University. This technique allows for transportation of reagents across the cell membrane through the user of 
          highly charged moieties.
