## Let's Hike!

Once the hiker allows the application  to use their current location, they are prompted to enter their hike preferences: the maximum distance to the hike, the minimum length of the hike, and the minimum star rating. They will be given hike options that meet this criteria with information including the
location, length, ascent, stars and difficulty. They will also be provided weather information on that particular hike location so they can decide if the conditions are adequate to proceed. If they don't like the hike option they are given they can click "next" until they find one they like.
